# Project Structure Guide

This project is organized as follows:

- The main application entry point is [src/app.ts](mdc:src/app.ts).
- HTTP routes and controllers are located in [src/http/controllers/](mdc:src/http/controllers), with subdirectories for jobs, departments, and organization.
- Domain models containing business logic and data validation are in [src/models/](mdc:src/models).
- Business logic is implemented in application services in [src/services/](mdc:src/services), organized by domain. Services orchestrate use cases by coordinating domain models and repositories.
- Data access is handled by repositories in [src/repositories/](mdc:src/repositories). These provide an abstraction over the database, with both in-memory and Prisma-backed implementations.
- Shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are in [src/lib/dtos/](mdc:src/lib/dtos).
- Custom shared types are in [src/@types/](mdc:src/@types).
- Middleware (such as JWT verification) is in [src/http/middlewares/](mdc:src/http/middlewares).
- Environment configuration is handled in [src/lib/env.ts](mdc:src/lib/env.ts).
- Database schema and migrations are managed with Prisma in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) and [prisma/migrations/](mdc:prisma/migrations).
