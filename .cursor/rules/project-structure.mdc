# Project Structure Guide

This project is organized as follows:

- The main application entry point is [src/app.ts](mdc:src/app.ts).
- HTTP routes and controllers are located in [src/http/controllers/](mdc:src/http/controllers), with subdirectories for jobs, departments, and organization.
- Business logic is implemented in [src/services/](mdc:src/services), organized by domain (jobs, departments, organization, job-applications, factories).
- Data access and repository patterns are in [src/repositories/](mdc:src/repositories), with both in-memory and Prisma-backed implementations.
- Shared types and DTOs are in [src/@types/](mdc:src/@types) and [src/lib/dtos/](mdc:src/lib/dtos).
- Middleware (such as JWT verification) is in [src/http/middlewares/](mdc:src/http/middlewares).
- Environment configuration is handled in [src/lib/env.ts](mdc:src/lib/env.ts).
- Database schema and migrations are managed with Prisma in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) and [prisma/migrations/](mdc:prisma/migrations).
