# Database Structure

- The database schema is defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) and managed with Prisma.
- Key models: Organization, Department, Job, JobTag, JobApplication.
- Important enums: WorkplaceLocation, EmploymentType, JobStatus, JobApplicationStatus.
- Migrations are stored in [prisma/migrations/](mdc:prisma/migrations).
- Each model is related to the business logic and API endpoints (e.g., jobs, applications, departments).
