# HTTP API Structure

- The API uses Fastify as the web framework, with CORS and JWT authentication enabled ([src/app.ts](mdc:src/app.ts)).
- Main route groups:
  - Organization: [src/http/controllers/organization/routes.ts](mdc:src/http/controllers/organization/routes.ts)
  - Departments: [src/http/controllers/departments/routes.ts](mdc:src/http/controllers/departments/routes.ts)
  - Jobs: [src/http/controllers/jobs/routes.ts](mdc:src/http/controllers/jobs/routes.ts)
- Protected endpoints use the [verifyJwt](mdc:src/http/middlewares/verify-jwt.ts) middleware for authentication.
- Each route file registers controllers for CRUD and business actions, delegating to service and repository layers.
